# Big Mart Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

**Introduction:**

Sales prediction is a critical aspect of retail management, enabling businesses to optimize inventory, enhance customer satisfaction, and improve overall profitability. This project aims to analyze historical sales data from Big Mart to develop a machine learning model that predicts future sales based on various influencing factors such as store characteristics, product categories, and seasonal trends.

**Problem Statement:**

The aim of this project is to develop predictive model to forecast sales for Big Mart outlets based on historical sales data and relevant features such as store type, product category and to optimize inventory management and enhance sales strategies by accurately predicting sales trends for each outlet.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used for this project has 8,523 records ang has the following variables:

Item_Identifier - unique identifier for each item

Item_Weight - weight of the item

Item_Fat_Content - categorical variable describing the fat content of the item

Item_Visibility - the percentage of total display area allocated to this particular item in all stores

Item_Type - category to which the item belongs

Item_MRP - maximum retail price of the item

Outlet_Identifier - unique identifier for each outlet

Outlet_Establishment_Year - the year in which the outlet was established

Outlet_Size - size of the outlet

Outlet_Location_Type - location type of the outlet

Outlet_Type - Type of the outlet

Item_Outlet_Sales - sales of the particular item in the particular outlet (target variable)

**Project Description:**

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to analyze insights and patterns from the Big Mart Sales Dataset.

• Performed Data Pre-processing steps to prepare data for modelling.

• Developed Machine Learning Models such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost

• Achieved an RMSE 0.5 with CatBoost Model

**Observation:**

CatBoost Model performs better in our project compared to other models.

**Skills:** Machine Learning · Exploratory Data Analysis · Linear Regression · Random Forest · XGBoost · CatBoost · Data Pre-Processing
